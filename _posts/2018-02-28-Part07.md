title: Part 07 - Corgi Engine
---

Our group started to use the Corgi Engine from the asset store to help us create the platformer part of our game more quickly!
It came with a couple of prefabs and scripts that we can use as placeholders for now as we plan and test some levels.

In the last two weeks, I implemented the first two levels into the game. We agreed as a group we wanted the levels to progress and try to
teach the player how to play so I made a quick list of what the player would encounter or learn on each level:

The levels were redesigned from our old project:

Level 1
[Old]
![list](/images/level1new.png){: .center-image }
[New]
![list](/images/level1old.png){: .center-image }

Level 2
[Old]
![list](/images/level2old.png){: .center-image }
[New]
![list](/images/level2new.png){: .center-image }

The group and I playtested them and made adjustments, we also now have some pages to test the AR so I am planning to get some other
players (friends & family) to playtest our game next week!
