title: Winter Break - Changing concepts

The group did not like the story of the first game (mostly because no one knew how it would end or where we were going with the narrative).
So I made up a quick gamedoc, with a flexible story and a few characters (and hoped we could focus on the gameplay). This idea ended up scrapped.
