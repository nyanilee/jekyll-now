title: Week 01 - Our First Level
---

Despite not coming to mutual agreements about the story and game mechanics, we as a group decided to move forward anyways and create a prototype of our first level.

To create our first level, I decided to test out the Fungus toolkit availible in Unity because I heard that it was extremely useful for creating narrative based games and had many tutorials availible.

Fungus uses Flowcharts to handle a variety of events. We can control what happens in the scene when the user starts the game, inputs certain things on their mouse or keyboard, and when or more precisely, how users interact with sprites. Although one can do many things in Fungus very easily, there were some simple things that could not be done through the Fungus GUI such as making an if statement test more than one variable (ie. if (var1 && var2 == true ... do such and such)). However, these issues might be overcome by messing around with the code.
