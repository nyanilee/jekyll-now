title: Week 01 - Our First Level

Despite not coming to mutual agreements about the story and game mechanics, we as a group decided to move forward anyways and create a prototype of our first level.

To create our first level, I decided to test out the Fungus toolkit because I had heard it is extremely useful in creating narrative based games and had many tutorials availible.
