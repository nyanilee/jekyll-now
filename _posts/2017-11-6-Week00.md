title: Week 00 - Getting Started
---

This week the team got together for the first time and established who is doing what for our non-conventional, time travelling, murder mystery, story-driven, 2D puzzler game. A mouthful I know. This week was primarily brainstorm sessions for the story, characters, settings, and mechanics of the game. Our goal was to complete the game design document however, that was not accomplished.
