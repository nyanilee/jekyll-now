title: Week 00 - Getting Started
---

The team got together for the first time and established who is doing what for our non-conventional, time travelling, murder mystery, story-driven, 2D puzzler game. A mouthful, I know. This week was primarily a brainstorm session for the story, characters, settings, and mechanics of the game. Our goal was to complete the game design document however, this was not accomplished.

My role is Producer, so my job is to keep the group on track and moving forward. After a few days of disagreements, I asked each member to come up with some general story that would fit with the mechanics, and we would anonymously vote for the best one and just work with it. I asked everyone to be prepared by Friday, so we can decide and complete the game design document on the weekend. We did vote on a plot, however there were more disagreements the next day.

Seems like a time travelling, murder mystery game is hard to do right.
