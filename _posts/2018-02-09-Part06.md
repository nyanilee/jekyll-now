title: Part 06 - Unity Collab! (finally)
---

In the past two weeks, each member implemented (tiled) their level using Unity collab with placeholder assets.

We are tracking the progress here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwhVx8l7OFUJJonHGYOqlOIUutYH4ne4yce13UiWwAg/edit?usp=sharing

The design of all levels so far: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UBOCi-Mg1zFlaprPMJvar-AKEXE8hz6cZQFIqWdUWDM/edit?usp=sharing

As for my level, I tiled the map and created two scripts for enemy AI. My level requires a spell where the player must speed up
to get to the end but they will not be able to see that far ahead of them, thus they have to time that. I have been testing/adjusting 
the speed in the rulebook however, some problems sometimes occur such as the character is randomly stopping or being snagged on something.

Also took a crack at adding a spell/rule to the rulebook (currently requires looking through a bunch of files to find the right files).
Managed to add an "inverted keys rule" that only required creating a new JSON file and referencing/calling the right scripts.
