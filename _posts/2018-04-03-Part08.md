title: Part 08 - Levels!
---

In the past month I added and tested 2 levels and worked together with Greg to create a third level.
Thomas, June, and Jeanette added all the assets to make the levels beautiful!

Level 1

Level 2

Since I mentioned in the last dev blog the goals of level 1 and 2, I can mention the ones for level 3:
- Players first interaction with movable, levitatable objects
- Players first interaction with shooting enemies
- Players must move through portals
- Players must place objects on buttons to open doors
- Players can use objects to block enemy fire or environmental projectiles

Level 3

Then I linked all the levels together and added a main menu for the start of the game.
